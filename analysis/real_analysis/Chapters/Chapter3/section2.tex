\section{Subsequences}\label{section_3.2}

\begin{definition}
  Let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence, and let  $\{n_k\} \susbseteq \Z^+$ such that
  $n_k<n_{k+1}$. We call the sequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ a \textbf{Subsequence} of $\{x_n\}$. If
  $\{x_{n_k}\}$ converges, we call its limit the \textbf{subsequential limit} of $\{x_n\}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{3.2.1}\
  A sequence $\{x_n\}$ converges to a point  $x$ if  and only if every subsequence
  $\{x_{n_k}\}$ converges to $x$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Clearly if $x_n \rightarrow x$, then every subsequence  $x_{n_k} \rightarrow x$, (since subsequences
  can be thought of as subsets of thier parent sequences). On the other hand, let
  $x_{n_k} \rightarrow x$ for $\{\n_k\} \subseteq \Z^+$. Then for  $\epsilon>0$, there is a
  $K \in \Z^+$ for which  $d(x_{n_k},x)<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ for $k \geq K$. Let $N \in \Z^+$, and
  choose  $n \geq max\{N,K\}$, then  $d(x_n,x) \leq d(x_n,x_{n_k})+d(x_{n_k},d)<\epsilon$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{3.2.2}
  If $\{x_n\}$ is a sequence in a compact metric space  $X$, then some subsequence of
  $\{x_n\}$ converges to a point  $x$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  If $\{x_n\}$ is finite, then thre is an  $x \in \{x_n\}$ and a sequence  $\{n_k\}$ with
  $n_k<n_{k+1}$ such that  $x_{n_i}=x$ for  $1 \leq i \leq k$, then the subsequence converges
  to  $x$.

  Now if  $\{x_n\}$ is infinite, there is a limit point  $x \in X$ of $\{x_n\}$, then
  choose  $n_i$ such that  $d(x,x_i)<\frac{1}{i}$ for $1 \leq i \leq k$. Obtaining  $\{n_k\}$
  from this, we see that  $n_k<n_{k+1}$, and so we get that  $\{x_{n_k}\}$ converges to  $x$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  Every bounded sequence in $\R^k$ contains a convergent subsequence.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}\label{3.2.3}
  The subsequential limits of $\{x_n\}$ is a metric space  $X$ form a closed subset of
  $X$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $E$ be the set of all subsequential limits of $\{x_n\}$, and let  $x$ be a limit point
  of  $E$. Choose $n_i$ such that $x_{n_i} \neq x$ and let  $\delta=d(x,x_{n_i})$, for
  $1 \leq i \leq k$. Then consier the sequence  $\{n_k\}$, since  $x$ is a limit point of  $E$,
  there is an  $x' \in E$ for which  $d(x,x')<\frac{\delta}{2^i}$. Thus there is an $N_I>n_i$
  such that $d(x',x_{n_i})<\frac{\delta}{2^i}$, thus $d(x,x_{n_i})<\frac{\delta}{2^i}$. So
  $\{x_n\}$ converges to  $x$ and  $x \in E$.
\end{proof}
