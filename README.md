# Mathematics Notes.

Here is the repository for my notes in various topics in mathematics. This
repository will be puiblicly available. As a disclaimer, the notes here are
heavily based on books that were used in conjunction, and are meant to acoompany
those books. These notes SHOULD NOT be considered as original work, as they
contain the results and topics contained in the accompnying book and other
resources.

These notes are meant to be used as supplimentary material when studying a
topic, and should only be used as such.
