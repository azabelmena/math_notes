# Mathematics Notes.

Here is the repository for my notes in various topics in mathematics. This
repository will be puiblicly available. As a disclaimer, the notes here are
heavily based on books that were used in conjunction, and are meant to acoompany
those books. These notes SHOULD NOT be considered as original work, as they
contain the results and topics contained in the accompnying book and other
resources.

These notes are meant to be used as supplimentary material when studying a topic,
and should only be used as such. These notes are also continually updated and
under constant revision. I would appreciate it that any typos and errata be
reported so that I can revise the content.

These notes do not contain the pdf files, and must be compiled with LaTeX. You
can use your favorite LaTeX editor to compile the pdfs, or you can use the
terminal command `latexmk -pdf` in the relevant directory to compile the notes
you wish to view.
