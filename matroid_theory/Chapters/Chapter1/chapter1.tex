The goal of matroid theory is to provide an abstract theory of independence.
Matroids have their roots in algebra (especially linear algebra), graph theory,
and combinatorics; and each field provides a distinct flavor to the subject. The
notion of independence was first covere by Whitney in $1935$, and then Van der
Waerden, in $1937$, in his seminal work ``Moderne Algebra''. Gian Carlo Rota
would also stumble upon the theory indepednetly. Pioneering work would later be
done by Tutte, Nakasawa, Birkhoff, and Mac Lane.

Perhaps the most important aspect of matroids is that they have several
equivalent definitions. We begin by studying two of them.
