\section{Irreducible Components}

\begin{definition}
    Let $k$ be a field. We call an algebraic set $X \subseteq \A^n(k)$
    \textbf{reducible} if it can be written as the union of two algebraic sets;
    that is, there exist $X_1,X_2 \subseteq \A^n(k)$ such that $X=X_1 \cup X_2$.
    We call an algebraic set \textbf{irreducible} if it is not reducible.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label{example_1.7}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(1)] The algebraic sets defined by the equations $y^2=x^3-x$,
            $y^2=x^3+x^2$, and $z^2=x^2+y^2$ in $\A^2(\R)$ and $\A^3(\R)$,
            respecively, are irreducible.

        \item[(2)] The algebraic set described by the equation
            $y^2-xy-x^2y+x^2=0$ is reducible in $\A^2(\R)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}\label{1.5.1}
    An algebraic set is reducible if, and only if its ideal is prime.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $k$ be a field, and  $X \subseteq \A^n(k)$. Suppose that the ideal
    $I(X)$ is not prime. Let $f_1f_2 \in I(X)$, but $f_1,f_2 \not\in I(X)$.
    Then
    \begin{equation*}
        X=(X \cap V(f_1)) \cup (X \cap V(f_2))
    \end{equation*}
    and $X \cap V(f_1) \subseteq X$ and $X \cap V(f_2) \subseteq X$. This makes
    $X$ reducible, by definition.

    Conversely, suppose that $X$ is reducible, and that $X=X_1 \cup X_2$ for
    $X_1, X_2 \subseteq \A^n(k)$. Then $I(X) \subseteq I(X_1)$ and $I(X)
    \subseteq I(X_2)$. Let $f_1 \in I(X_1)$ and $f_2 \in I(X_2)$, but $f_1,f_2
    \not\in I(X)$. Then $f_1f_2 \in I(X)$, but $f_1,f_2 \not\in I(X)$, so that
    $I(X)$ is not prime.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{1.5.2}
    Any collection of algebraic sets has a minimal member.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    If $\{X_\a\}$ is a collection of algebraic sets in $\A^n$, then by theorem
    \ref{1.4.2} the collection of ideals $\{I(X_\a)\}$ has a maximal member.
    Choose such a maximal member $I(X_{\a_0})$, then the corresponding algebraic
    set $X_{\a_0}$ is a minimal member of the collection $\{X_\a\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{1.5.3}
    Any algebraic set can be uniquely expressed as the disjoint union of
    irreducible algebraic sets. That is; for any algebraic set $X \subseteq
    \A^n$, there exist unique pairwise disjoint $X_1, \dots, X_m \subseteq \A^n$
    for which
    \begin{equation*}
        X=X_1 \cup \dots \cup X_m
    \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We first show that such a decomposition exists for every algebraic set in
    $\A^n$. Let  $\Sc$ be the collection of all algebraic sets which cannot be
    expressed as a (not necessarily disjoint) union of (not necessarily unique)
    irreducible algebraic sets. Let $X$ be a minimal element of $\Sc$. Then
    $X$ is not irreducible. Hence there exist $X_1, X_2 \subseteq \A^n$ for
    which $X=X_1 \cup X_2$; suppose further that $X_1,X_2 \subseteq X$. By the
    minimality of $X$,  $X_1, X_2 \not\in \Sc$, so that
    \begin{equation*}
        X_i=\bigcup_{j=1}^{m_i}{X_{ij}}
    \end{equation*}
    where each $X_{ij}$ is irreducible. This makes
    \begin{equation*}
        X=\bigcup_{i=1,j=1}^{m,m_i}{X_{ij}}
    \end{equation*}
    which contradicts that $X \in \Sc$. Therefore $\Sc$ must be empty, and every
    algebraic set can be expressed as the union of irreducible algebraic sets.

    Now, take  $X=X_1 \cup \dots X_m$, where each $X_i$ is irreducible, and
    discard all those $X_i$ for which  $X_i \subseteq X_j$ for all $i \neq j$.
    This makes $X$ a disjoint union. Now, suppose that  $X=Y_1 \cup \dots Y_r$.
    Then
    \begin{equation*}
        X_i=\bigcup_{j=1}^r{(Y_j \cap X_i)}
    \end{equation*}
    so that $X_i \subseteq Y_j$ for some $j$. Similarly, we get that  $Y_j
    \subseteq X_k$ for some $k$. Thus $X_i \subseteq X_k$, but since $X$ is
    already a disjoint union, this makes  $i=k$ so that $X_i=Y_j$ and $m=r$.
    Thus the decomposition of $X$ into mutually disjoint irreducible algebraic
    sets is unique.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Let $k$ be a field, and $X \subseteq \A^n(k)$ an algebraic set. Let $X=X_1
    \cup \dots X_m$ the decomposition of $X$ into the union of pairwise disjoint
    irreducible algebraic sets. We call each $X_i$ an \textbf{irreducible
    component} of $X$.
\end{definition}
