./section3.tex:140: Undefined control sequence.
<recently read> \R 
                   
l.140 ...reates lower bounds for any subset of $\R
                                                  $; not just the bounded ones.
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
